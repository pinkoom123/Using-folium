This is a code using folim library for map creation. 
The folim library uses open_street_maps for its genereation of map.
I used rainfall data ,collected from six stations across Ghana,ie Axim, Kumasi,Saltpond,Oda,Ada and Tema.
Instead of 365 days, from the data, we had 276 days, beacause of missing data.
Found the mean of the rainfall and used, to represent the respective stations on the map.
